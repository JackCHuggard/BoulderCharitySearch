		'It is the mission of the Humane Society of Boulder Valley to protect and enhance the lives of companion animals by promoting healthy relationships between pets and people. We were founded more than a century ago in 1902, yet this mission holds true today as we counter animal neglect and cruelty and partner with other animal welfare organizations, sharing our mutual mission of saving more animals\' lives.
		
		The Humane Society of Boulder Valley provides shelter and care to more than 7,000 animals each year, with 95 percent of these animals being successfully adopted or reunited with their guardians. Our success rates are supported by our Behavior Modification program; helping shelter dogs and cats overcome behavior problems, our Shelter Medicine program; providing quality and compassionate medical services to shelter animals, and our Safety Net program; ensuring healthy relationships are supported in times of need and crisis.

		Our Adoption program allow us the ability to open our doors to thousands of animals due to overcrowding or lack of resources in other shelters throughout our region. The Transfer program also enables us to offer a greater variety of animals to our adoption clients. Every year we partner with over 50 other animal welfare agencies to provide more care and services for homeless pets.',

		'The Boulder Opera is committed to making opera accessible, inspiring and engaging to the community. Our goal is to develop new audiences for this old art form, enrich the lives of our community, and provide opportunity to local musicians. Our Childrenâ€™s productions explore repertoire in reduced versions with a narrator and an ensemble orchestra. And our full-length productions, which include standard, contemporary, and rarely performed works, are experimental in nature, seeking to reach and entertain new audiences and delight the old. Our outreach program is designed to inspire and educate the young generation about opera and to make connections to other disciplines through our study guides and free workshops.',
