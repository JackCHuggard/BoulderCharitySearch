	<div style="color: #2b1e14;">

	We are a team of students at the University of Colorado looking to produce an easier searching experience for potential volunteers and donors in to locate the right nonprofit for their cause in the City of Boulder. Whether they would like to volunteer at a soup kitchen, build a home, or clean up a hiking trail, BCS will find the ideal nonprofits and supply them with the information they need to contact, volunteer, and donate to those charities.

	&nbsp;

	Our motive is to not only make the search experience easier, but also to increase the notoriety of smaller nonprofits in Boulder. We want to increase charitable activity and spread awareness by building a network based on compatibility, rather than popularity.
